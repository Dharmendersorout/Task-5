Titanic Survival Prediction
A machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset.

## 🛠 Project Overview
This project involves building a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like:

Passenger Class (Pclass)

Gender (Sex)

Age

Fare

Embarked Port

Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard (SibSp)

Number of Parents/Children aboard (Parch)

We perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and apply machine learning models to make predictions.

scikit-learn (for modeling)

## ⚙️ Workflow
Data Loading: Load Titanic dataset using pandas.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables.

Feature engineering (creating new useful features).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize patterns and relationships among features.

Model Building:
Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

Evaluate performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, etc.

Prediction and Conclusion:

Predict survival on new/unseen data.
